# Ontology Change Plug-in
An ontology Belief Change plug-in for Protégé

This plug-in was designed to perform Belief Change operations on ontologies inside Protégé, a free ontology editor.
The idea is to use Contraction and Revision algorithms to solve the problem of adding a new information in a consistent way or
removing a no-longer-desired information in an intelligent way.
